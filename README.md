# vidya-clone

This project is a clone of the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist](https://www.vipvgm.net/) created and maintained by Cats777 over at [aersia.net](https://www.aersia.net/).

I started this project both as a fun side project and as a way to practice building web-based applications. Because of this, there are many things in this project that could be better. I also do not plan to maintain this project. I have gotten it to a state that I am happy with and will not likely be adding to it from this point forward.

A demo of the project in its current state is [here](https://krisairdancer.github.io/vidya-clone/).
